## Installing MongoDB (Easy Steps)
Step 1
Go to the official MongoDB website and click on the Download button.
Choose the version that matches your computer (Windows / macOS / Linux).

Step 2
Open the downloaded file and keep clicking Next → Next → Install → Finish.
(No special settings are required.)

Step 3
After installation, open the Search bar on your system and search for
MongoDB Compass.

Step 4
Open MongoDB Compass.
You will see a connection URL.
Just click on Connect, and MongoDB will start running on localhost.

Step 5
To create a database:
Click on the “+” (Create Database) button
Enter the Database name
Enter the Collection name
Click Create

Now you can open the collection and add any number of documents (entries).

**Important Note**
The real power of a database is used when it is connected to a website or application.
To do that, we must connect MongoDB with JavaScript code, which we will learn next.

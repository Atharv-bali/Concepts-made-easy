## Dynamic Programming (DP)
What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing its result for future use.

**When do we use DP?**

Use DP when all or most of the following are true:

--> The problem can be broken into overlapping subproblems

--> The problem has optimal substructure
(solution of the whole depends on solutions of subproblems)

--> You are asked to find:

Minimum / Maximum

Number of ways

Best / Optimal value

True / False (possible or not)

--> The problem involves choices at each step

--> Subsequence / subset is mentioned
(not necessarily continuous like subarray)

**Common DP Clues in Questions**

If you see words like:

minimum cost

maximum profit

number of ways/number of distinct ways.

can we reach

best strategy

longest / shortest

**Think DP immediately**

## Approaches in dp: 

1) 1-D based: Used when state depends on one variable. 
Refer Ques-1,
2) 2-D based
3) String based
4) Grid based
5) Game strategy

## Problem Statement
Leetcode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-1s-are-at-least-length-k-places-away/description/


##  Intuition

To find the number of zeros between two `1`s, we use the formula:

```
(current index of 1) − (previous index of 1) − 1
```

### Why this works?

* The difference between two indices gives the total gap.
* Subtracting `1` removes the positions of the two `1`s themselves.
* The result is exactly the **number of zeros in between**.

### Example Breakdown

Consider the binary array:

```
10001001
```

* First `1` at index **0** and next `1` at index **4**:

  ```
  4 − 0 − 1 = 3 zeros
  ```
* Next pair: `1` at index **4** and next at **7**:

  ```
  7 − 4 − 1 = 2 zeros
  ```

### Applying to the Problem

The problem states that **each pair of `1`s must be at least `k` apart**.

So if we consider the **first 1** and **last 1**, their distance will always be the largest — and if even that violates the condition, no other pair can satisfy it.

Thus, we simply check the distance between every pair using:

```
(i - prev - 1) >= k
```

If any pair violates this rule, return `false`.

##  Example

Suppose:

```
nums = [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1], k = 2
```

* Between index 0 and 3 → `3 − 0 − 1 = 2` ✔ (OK)
* Between index 3 and 7 → `7 − 3 − 1 = 3` ✔ (OK)

Result → **true**

If `k = 3`:

* Between index 0 and 3 → `2 < 3` ❌ → return **false**

##  Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool kLengthApart(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size(), prev = -1;

        // Iterate through array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            // Skip zeros
            if (nums[i] == 0)
                continue;

            // If this is the first time we see a 1
            if (prev == -1) {
                prev = i;
            }
            else {
                // Check distance between two 1s
                if (i - prev - 1 < k)
                    return false;
                prev = i;  // update previous index
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
